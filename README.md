# Professional-README-Generator

# Description
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

# Usage
By entering the according data in the command line, this application will generate a professional readme.

To add a screenshot, create an assets/images folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

# License
The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use https://choosealicense.com/

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

# Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
